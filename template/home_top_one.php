		  	<h2>Mission</h2>
		  		<p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;">History unfolds the fact that police is as old as the civilization. Towards the Middle of the first century B.C. police emerged as a special institution in ancient Rome in the regime of Augustus.Manushanghita, the hieroglyphics of Emperor Ashoka, and the stories of renowned travelers are the main sources of our history. These sources also give clues to compose the fragmented history of Bangladesh Police. In Orthoshastra by Koutilla, nine types of spies are mentioned. During that period policing was confined to the efforts of collecting intelligence in order to curb anti-government activities and to maintain law and order in the society. The duties of undercover spies were extended such a way that they used to conduct surveillance over the activities of ministers, civil and military officials as well. In the process, all tangible means of temptations and instigations were deployed. Information about investigating techniques and investigating authorities may be found in Orthoshastra. The procedures of punishing the accused are also found in this book. Hence, it may be assumed that there happened to be a kind of police under the local autonomous system in the rural and urban areas.
